This project uses the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) for developing the application.

You must create and continuously maintain the following core documents:

1. Product Blueprint – Defines the product vision, primary capabilities, and key differentiators.
2. Architecture Document – Describes the system design, architecture, major components, integration patterns, and technical decisions.
3. Team Backlog – Contains the development work items.
   - The Team Backlog consists of Features and Enablers.
   - Complex Features or Enablers must be decomposed into User Stories or Spikes.
   - Prioritize User Stories and Spikes using SAFe/WIP/SWJF principles.
4. Development Log – Tracks progress, decisions, blockers, risks, and iterations.
5. User Guide – Provides clear end-user documentation for the product.

At every startup, you must:
- Review all existing documents,
- Understand the current product direction, architecture, and progress,
- Continue the work in alignment with the ongoing state of the project.
